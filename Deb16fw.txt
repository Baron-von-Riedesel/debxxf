 1. How to start the Debugger

 Create a link for deb16fw.exe. Executing deb16fw without a parameter will
 start the debugger without activating it. To activate the debugger
 double-click the symbol or right-click it and select menu item "Enter
 debugger". On Windows 3x/9x systems the screen will be switched to text
 mode (using helper dll deb16fwv.dll), on Windows NT/2k/XP (NT platform)
 the debugger will start deb16fwp, a simple terminal program.


 2. Known Problems

 - On win9x systems starting the debugger from a command line should 
   only be done combined with the /Q option as argument.
 - On NT platform some commands (.SFT, .CDS) won't work since "DOS"
   is emulated only.
 - On NT platform the "type" command won't work since it requires direct
   access to the video screen buffer.
 - Launching the debugger in Win31 standard mode will crash if the
   Windows 3.1 dosx.exe is used. With the replacement dosx.exe supplied
   with the HX runtime it works smoothly.
